The Incubation Management System is a dynamic and user-friendly web application designed to streamline and enhance the process of managing incubation projects. Built using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system is divided into four main sections: Screened, Selected, Incubated, and Graduated. This comprehensive platform empowers users to efficiently handle the various stages of an incubation program.

## Key Features:

- Drag-and-Drop Functionality:
Users can easily manage and organize project participants by dragging and dropping their names across different columns. This intuitive feature enhances user experience and simplifies the process of updating project statuses.

- Serial Number Assignment in Selected Column:
The Selected column incorporates a serial number along with participant names. This allows for a structured and ordered display of selected participants, facilitating easy identification and reference. The names are presented in descending order, providing a clear overview of the selected projects.

- Incubation Countdown:
In the Incubated column, users can input the number of days remaining until graduation for each project. This countdown feature ensures timely tracking of project timelines, enabling effective project management and planning.

- Dynamic Data Input:
The system allows users to add names dynamically, ensuring flexibility in adapting to changing project requirements. This feature ensures that the system remains versatile and can accommodate new participants seamlessly.

## Use Cases:

- Screening:
Project names are initially added to the Screened column. Users can review and move promising projects to the Selected column.

- Selection and Ordering:
In the Selected column, the system automatically assigns serial numbers to the projects, and the names are displayed in descending order. This feature facilitates quick decision-making based on project priorities.

- Incubation and Graduation:
The Incubated column enables users to input the remaining days until graduation for each selected project. As projects progress, they can be moved to the Graduated column upon completion.

## Benefits:

- Efficient Project Management:
The system simplifies project management by providing a visual representation of project stages and facilitating smooth transitions between columns.

- Real-Time Tracking:
Users can track project timelines and make informed decisions based on the dynamic data displayed in each column.

- User-Friendly Interface:
The drag-and-drop functionality and clear column organization contribute to an intuitive and user-friendly interface, reducing the learning curve for users.

The Incubation Management System serves as a valuable tool for incubation program coordinators and project managers, offering a comprehensive solution for organizing, tracking, and managing projects throughout their lifecycle.
